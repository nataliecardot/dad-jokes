This app was built using React. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Get Started

To launch the project:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**View locally**
1. Clone the repository
2. Using a command line tool, navigate to the directory's location
3. Run `npm install`, which installs all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server, opening the app in your default browser. (The command causes node to look for a scripts object in your package.json file, which in this case specifies "react-scripts start."). You also may open the app on the local server by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Notes

To deploy to GitHub Pages, I used the `gh-pages` [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages), with the help of [this tutorial](https://codeburst.io/deploy-react-to-github-pages-to-create-an-amazing-website-42d8b09cd4d).
